# amundsen-tui

ratatui frontend — renders the core event stream, submits commands, approval gate for Edit.

**Status:** active — two known gaps, see Progress below
**Scope:** crates/tui
**Owner:** Maximilian
**Last Updated:** 2026-06-10

**Progress (2026-08-29):** All 12 Steps implemented and tested — `972d150`,
audit-fixed in `bd09172`. Two Pitfall-level gaps, deliberate and disclosed
rather than silently missing: (1) tool-activity groups don't literally
"collapse after a short delay" — each call renders as one bounded summary
line instead, which bounds log flooding without needing a redraw timer,
but isn't the spec's literal mechanism. (2) Shift+Enter's terminal-
dependence (the Pitfall naming kitty/iTerm2/xterm specifically) couldn't
be verified against real terminal sessions in the sandbox this was built
in — there was no terminal to attach to, only a piped/non-interactive
shell. Ctrl+J is wired as a fallback on reasoning about the failure mode,
not empirical cross-terminal testing. A live run (planned separately)
should confirm or correct that reasoning — pay attention to both of these
during it.

**Progress (2026-08-29, live run):** First real-terminal session surfaced
two bugs, both fixed in `a2a28ba`: (1) `handle_key` routed straight to
`handle_approval_key`/`handle_prompt_key` while a card or prompt was
pending, and neither recognized Ctrl+C — a developer who didn't already
know the exact letter keybinding had no responsive key at all, which read
as the harness hanging/crashing. Ctrl+C now always resolves the pending
gate as a deny/decline. (2) `UserMessage` and `AssistantText` both
rendered `Style::default().fg(BRIGHT)`, so the two speakers were
visually identical in the log despite the Design section's stated
bright/normal split — assistant text is now bold-bright, user text is
terminal-default. Cards and the status bar now also spell out the Ctrl+C
keybinding inline, since it wasn't discoverable before. The two gaps
above (tool-activity collapse mechanism, Shift+Enter cross-terminal
verification) are still open — this session's terminal wasn't used to
re-verify Shift+Enter specifically.

**Progress (2026-08-29, follow-up):** A `/`-prefixed `UserMessage` (a
slash command) now renders dim rather than sharing plain user messages'
normal style, per developer request once `/help`/`/exit` landed in
amundsen-cli — otherwise a command looks identical to a chat message in
the log, undermining the point of having named commands at all. See
`is_command` in `ui.rs`; duplicates cli's own `/`-prefix check since tui
can't depend on cli (wrong direction) to reuse it.

**Progress (2026-08-29, second follow-up):** Two more requests from the
same live session: (1) user/assistant separation via color alone (plus
the earlier bright/normal split) still read as too subtle — assistant
text now gets a `●` marker on its first line, user text moved off
terminal-default onto a dedicated green (`USER` in `ui.rs`), and
`draw_log` inserts a blank line between every log entry, not just at the
user/assistant boundary. (2) fenced code blocks in assistant text were
rendering as raw text, backticks included — `highlight.rs` now parses
` ``` ` fences (`ui::split_code_fences`) and syntax-highlights the body
via `syntect` (bundled syntax/theme dumps, `default-fancy` feature — pure
Rust regex backend, no C toolchain dependency), inside a dim
`┌─ lang` / `│ ` / `└─` border; an unrecognized language tag falls back
to `syntect`'s plain-text syntax rather than refusing to render. Explicit
user choice: full syntax highlighting over a lighter bordered-only
treatment, accepting the added dependency, ~4MB larger release binary,
and `base16-ocean.dark` as the highlighting theme (no way to detect the
terminal's actual background — same open question as the deferred accent
color above; revisit together).

**Progress (2026-08-29, scrolling fix):** The developer reported the TUI
"has no scrolling capability" at all. Root cause: `ui::draw` called
`app.scroll.set_viewport_height(log_inner_height, app.log.len())` —
`log_inner_height` is real rendered rows, `app.log.len()` is *entry*
count, and `ScrollState::max_offset` computed `total_len.saturating_sub
(viewport_height)` from those two mismatched units. A handful of entries
routinely renders to far more rows than the viewport, so `max_offset`
stayed 0 long after there was real content below the fold — auto-follow
never advanced past the top, and manual scroll keys had nothing to move
into, since `draw_log`'s `.skip(app.scroll.offset)` was already being
applied to the correct (flattened-line) vector; only the offset itself
was wrong. Fixed by adding `App::total_lines()` (`app.rs`) — an exact
(not approximate) rendered-row count via a new pure `log::line_count`,
proven line-count-equal to `ui::render_entry`'s output for every
`LogEntry` variant except one narrow, self-correcting streaming edge
case — and using it everywhere `self.log.len()`/`app.log.len()` was
previously passed to a `ScrollState` method. `scroll.rs`'s doc comment
updated accordingly (it previously and incorrectly described the unit as
"whole entries"). Confirmed by reverting the `ui::draw` change alone and
watching the new regression test fail exactly as the user described,
then pass again once restored.

- **Layout:** Three horizontal bands: full-width scrollable conversation log (most of the height), single-line status bar, multi-line input area. No persistent sidebar in V0 — all ambient state lives in the two bottom bands or inline in the log.
- **Conversation Log:** Append-only rendered view of core events. Each event type maps to a distinct entry shape. Tool activity (ToolDispatched → ToolCompleted) renders inline as grouped entries per step. ThinkingStart emits a dim "thinking…" indicator; ThinkingEnd removes it — no content shown (dropped at source per amundsen-core). RetryAttempt renders as a visible inline entry with provider, status code, and message. Scroll: auto-follows new content when the view is at the bottom; disengages when the user scrolls up; re-engages on G / End. Line scroll via arrow keys or j/k; page scroll via PgUp / PgDn.
- **Approval Card:** ToolApprovalRequested renders as an inline card in the conversation log, visually distinct from all other entries via a full-width border and the single accent color. Approve/reject keybindings are labeled inside the card. Input is blocked while a card is pending — the developer cannot queue new submissions until the gate is resolved.
- **Input Area:** Multi-line textarea. Enter submits (sends Submit command); Shift+Enter inserts a newline. Ctrl+C cancels the active turn (sends Cancel); Ctrl+C with no active turn exits. Input is blocked while an approval card is pending.
- **Status Bar:** Single line, always visible. Shows: model name, turn/step counter ("T3 S2"), permission summary for the three built-in surfaces (read / shell / edit — each shown as allowed or denied), names of tools currently running within the active step (e.g. "tools: Read shell").
- **Palette:** No longer strictly monochrome as of 2026-08-29 — see the same-day Progress note below for why. Background: terminal default throughout. Text hierarchy: bright-bold with a leading `●` marker (assistant output), a dedicated green (user input), dim (tool metadata, status bar text, and a slash command as user input, since it's directed at the harness rather than the model). One accent color applied only to the approval card border and focused-input highlight. Specific accent color still deferred pending mascot palette decision. Fenced code blocks in assistant output get their own syntax-highlighted, per-language color set (see `highlight.rs`) inside a dim `┌─`/`│`/`└─` border, independent of this hierarchy.

## Decisions

- **Conversation-first layout — full-width log, status bar, input bar at bottom.** — Keeps the conversation as the primary surface; state lives in the status bar rather than consuming persistent screen space. Split-pane rejected for V0 — adds complexity without payoff until the conversation log is proven sufficient.

- **Approval card is inline in the conversation log, not a full-screen overlay.** — Inline preserves conversational context during review. Visually distinguished via border + accent color so it cannot be mistaken for assistant output. Input blocked while pending — the developer cannot accidentally bypass the gate by typing ahead.

- **Multi-line input; Enter submits, Shift+Enter inserts newline.** — Discussion-first posture benefits from longer prompts. Standard convention for multi-line TUI inputs. Single-line-only rejected as too restrictive for the intended interaction mode.

- **Minimal monochrome palette with one accent color in V0.** — Avoids colour decisions blocked on the open mascot palette. One accent is sufficient to make the approval card unmistakable. Rich theming deferred until the mascot palette is settled.

- **Thinking indicator shown; thinking content not shown.** — Content is dropped at source in amundsen-core per LlmClient contract. The indicator (ThinkingStart → dim spinner, ThinkingEnd → removed) gives awareness without log clutter.

- **Input blocked while an approval card is pending.** — Structural friction — the developer cannot queue submissions while an edit awaits approval. Consistent with "Edit is never allowlistable in any configuration" from the parent spec.

## Steps

1. Create crates/tui — Cargo.toml with ratatui, crossterm, tokio; depends on amundsen-core.

2. Define App struct: core event receiver, command sender, log snapshot, approval-pending flag, input buffer.
   - Why: Approval-pending flag drives input-blocking; keeping it on App avoids threading it through every handler.

3. Implement the event loop — multiplex crossterm keyboard events and core events onto a single tokio select.

4. Implement the three-band layout: conversation pane, status bar, input area.

5. Implement conversation log rendering — map each core event type to an entry shape; scrollable.

6. Implement tool-activity entries — ToolDispatched opens a dim entry; ToolCompleted closes it with result summary.

7. Implement the thinking indicator — ThinkingStart inserts a dim spinner entry; ThinkingEnd removes it.

8. Implement RetryAttempt rendering — visible inline entry with provider name, status code, message.

9. Implement the approval card — bordered accent-color inline entry, diff block, labeled approve/reject keys; block input while pending.
   - Verify: Typing ahead while a card is pending is silently dropped; card requires an unambiguous explicit keypress to resolve.

10. Implement the status bar — model name, T/S counter, read/shell/edit permission summary, active tool count.

11. Implement multi-line input textarea — Enter submits, Shift+Enter newlines, Ctrl+C cancels or exits.

12. Apply minimal palette — bright/normal/dim text hierarchy; accent on approval card border and focused-input highlight only.

## Pitfalls

- Blocking the ratatui draw loop on channel reads — use non-blocking poll or a short select timeout.
- Approval card dismissed by an accidental keypress — require an unambiguous labeled key ('y'/'n' or similar), not Enter.
- Tool-activity entries flooding the log during parallel runs — group by step; collapse completed groups after a short delay.
- Shift+Enter behavior is terminal-dependent — test under kitty, iTerm2, and plain xterm; have a fallback binding.

## Out of Scope

- Mouse support — keyboard-only in V0.
- Color theming system — minimal palette only; rich theming blocked on mascot palette decision.
- Syntax highlighting in diff blocks — plain text diff in V0.
- Conversation log search or filtering.
- Split-pane layout with persistent sidebar — deferred.
- Session persistence, conversation save/restore — out of V0 per parent spec.
- Web client rendering — V1.
